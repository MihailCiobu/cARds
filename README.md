# Welcome to cARds, my first AR project!

cARds is a simple AR game, in which you can focus your AR camera on given playing cards and see some neat stuff! Currently, there are 3 cards available:

1) Joker card

3) Jack of Hearts

This games features each of the 4 user interactions, namely:

* **Non-Diegetic** (intro song + text displayed in top left corner)
* **Meta** (fade-in effect at the beginning of the game)
* **Diegetic** (all the content of the cards + clickable Jack of Hearts card)
* **Spatial** (text displaying when the Joker and Ace of Spades cards are in focus)

Note: For the Jack of Hearts, make sure to tap the card via your phone screen. This will trigger an animation.
